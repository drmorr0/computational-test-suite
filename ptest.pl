# This is the core file for a suite of test scripts that are designed to be modular and easily
# extensible.  The goal is to minimize the amount of development time needed to get a new set of
# experiments running, because right now I do a lot of repeat work.  This script provides the
# following capabilities:
#
#   1) Initialization - create directory structure, determine types of experiments/how many
#      experiments to run, where to get input data, where to place output data, figure out whether
#      to append results to an existing set of experiments, etc.  Also determine if any experiments
#      should be run on a remote machine.
#   2) Run the experiments - for each test, construct the command line necessary to run the
#      experiment.  Determine whether to run experiments sequentially or on multiple cores.  Collect
#      the output and do something with it.
#   3) Parsing and cleanup - parse the output data into CSV, or LaTeX format (or other formats 
#      as desired).  Protect directory structure from writing so as to avoid accidentally
#      overwriting data.
#
# The goal is to eventually add in hooks so that I can also perform custom tasks at each stage of
# the process.  This way for each set of experiments I run, I can only focus on the parts of the
# experiment that differ or are unusual, rather than having to write or modify the entire thing from
# the ground up.
